# Prime Factorization in Python

This Python script helps you find the special numbers that can multiply together to make the given number. These special numbers are called prime factors. Prime factorization is like breaking a number into its building blocksâ€”numbers that can't be divided any further except by 1 and themselves.

## What It Does

- **Factorization:** It finds the special numbers (prime factors) that, when multiplied together, give you the original number.
- **Easy Input:** Just type the number, and the script does the rest for you.
- **Helpful for Math:** This process is used in various math problems and helps understand how numbers are built from their simplest parts (prime numbers).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
